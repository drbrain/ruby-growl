== DESCRIPTION:

A pure-ruby growl notifier for UDP and GNTP growl protocols.  ruby-growl
allows you to perform Growl notifications from machines without growl
installed (for example, non-OSX machines).

What is growl?  Growl is a really cool "global notification system originally
for Mac OS X".

You can receive Growl notifications on various platforms and send them from
any machine that runs Ruby.

OS X: http://growl.info
Windows: http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/
Linux: http://github.com/mattn/growl-for-linux

ruby-growl also contains a command-line notification tool named 'growl'.  It
is almost completely option-compatible with growlnotify.  (All except for -p
is supported, use --priority instead.)

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Requires "Listen for incoming notifications" enabled on the growl server

== INSTALL:

  gem install ruby-growl
